* A message broker is a software that enables applications, systems, and services to communicate with each other and exchange information
* This allows interdependent services to _"talk"_ with one another directly, even if they were written in different languages or implemented on different platforms
* validate, store, route, and deliver messages to the appropriate destinations

## Models
* Point-To-Point
	*  distribution pattern utilized in message queues with a one-to-one relationship between the message's sender and receiver
* Publish-Subscribe messaging
	* distribution pattern, often referred to as _"pub/sub"_, the producer of each message publishes it to a topic, and multiple message consumers subscribe to topics from which they want to receive messages
