In Programming, data type is an attribute associated with a ==piece of data that tells a computer system how to interpret its value==
* ### Primitive Data Type
	* Basic building blocks of data
		* Integer 
		* Float
		* Char, Boolean, Date, time, Date Time
* ### Composite Data Type
	* combine basic types to store more complex information
		* String, Array, pointers 
* ### User Defined 
	* make your own data types by combining or modifying the ones that already exist
		* Enum, Structure, Union 

# Compile time vs Runtime 
* ### Compile Time
	* This is when you code is being translated (compiled) from text into a set of machine instructions. A compile time error would be an error that occurs while compiling your code, such a syntax error.
* ### Runtime 
	*  This is when your code is actually running on the machine. A run time error would be an error that occurs while running your code, such as a buffer overflow or a null value error.
* ### Build Time
	*  This is kind of the macro version of compile time. Things like compiling files, gathering dependencies, and creating executables happen at build time.
* ### IDE Time
	* This is when code is being written and checked for syntax errors or problems detectable by the IDE. Errors found in this phase must be resolved before the code can be built or compiled.
# Static vs Dynamic Typing
## Static 
A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. For some languages this means that you as the programmer must specify what type each variable is;
Ex/ C, C++, Java, Rust, Go

## Dynamic
 programmer can write a little quicker because you do not have to specify types every time, Most dynamically typed languages do allow you to provide type information, but do not require it.
 Ex/ Python, JavaScript, PHP
