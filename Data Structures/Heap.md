* [[Trees]] based data structure that satisfies a heap property
* Max heap - any given node C with parent node P then value is greater or equal to C
* Min heap - any given node C with parent node P then value is less than or equal to C
* In a heap the highest or lowest priority element is always stored at the root
* **Not sorted, regarded as partially ordered** 
* A complete binary tree - every level,Â _except possibly the last_, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible

# Operations
in python heapq module allows us to treat a list as a heap(usually implemented as min heaps)
```python
import heapq

heapq.heapify(list)           #rearranges list into a valid heap 
heapq.heappush(list,5)        # appending an element
minEl = heapq.heappop(list)  #pops smallest element 0(logN) n in heap
heap.heappushpop(list,5)      #push new element and pop smallest at same time

max = heapq.nlargest(3,list)  #largest 3 elements
min = heapq.nsmallest(3,list) #smallest 3 elements

```

#### Storing tuples with heaps
When you use heapq with a tuple in Python, it uses the first element of the tuple as the primary key for sorting and maintaining the heap order. If multiple tuples have the same first element, it will use the second element, then the third, and so on, to break ties.

in case u forgot range(start, stop, step)
