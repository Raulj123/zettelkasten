[1,3,4,5] or [9, "hi", false]
* Ordered collection of data
* Find an element based on index
* Stored in contiguous memory(each element is next to one another in mem)

## Time Complexity 
- Read -> o(1)
- Insert -> o(n)
- Delete -> o(n)

# Linked List
() -> () -> () -> 
* Each element in list has a [[Pointer]] which has next address of next element 
* Do not have to be stored next to each other 
* Not index based 

## Time Complexity 
* Read -> o(n)
* Insert -> o(1)
* Delete -< o(1)
