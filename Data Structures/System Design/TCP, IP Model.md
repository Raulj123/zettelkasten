# TCP
* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is connection-oriented, meaning once a connection has been established, data can be transmitted in both directions.

# IP Model
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a simpler, connectionless internet protocol in which error-checking and recovery services are not required.
