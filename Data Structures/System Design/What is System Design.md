* System design is the process of defining the architecture, interfaces, and data for a system that satisfies specific requirements.
*  A good system design requires us to think about everything, from infrastructure all the way down to the data and how it's stored.
## why should I care
* System design helps us define a solution that meets the business requirements.

# IP
* An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network (Internet Protocol) 
* Allows information to be sent between devices on a network
## Versions
#### IPv4
*  Uses a 32-bit numeric dot-decimal notation
*  Initially, it was more than enough but as internet adoption grew, we needed something better.
* Ex/ `102.22.192.181`
#### IPv6
* Introduced in 1998, uses 128-bit alphanumeric hexadecimal notation
* Ex/ _`2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`_
### Types
* Public 
	*  One primary address is associated with your whole network.
	* _Example: IP address provided to your router by the ISP._
* Private 
	* Private IP address is a unique IP number assigned to every device that connects to your internet network
	* _Example: IP addresses generated by your home router for your devices._
* Static
	* A static IP address does not change and is one that was manually created, as opposed to having been assigned.
		* _Example: They are usually used for important things like reliable geo-location services, remote access, server hosting, etc._
* Dynamic 
	* A dynamic IP address changes from time to time and is not always the same. It has been assigned by a [Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol) server.
	* _Example: They are more commonly used for consumer equipment and personal use._
	
# OSI Model
The OSI Model is a logical and conceptual model that defines network communication used by systems open to interconnection and communication with other systems. **It's based on the concept of splitting up a communication system into seven abstract layers, each one stacked upon the last.**

# Layers
![[osi-model.webp]]
## Application 
This is the only layer that directly ==interacts with data from the user==. Software applications like web browsers and email clients rely on the application layer to initiate communication. But it should be made clear that client software applications are not part of the application layer, rather the application layer ==is responsible for the protocols and data manipulation that the software relies on to present meaningful data to the user.== Application layer protocols include HTTP as well as SMTP.

## Presentation
The presentation layer is also called the Translation layer. ==The data from the application layer is extracted here and manipulated as per the required format to transmit over the network.== The functions of the presentation layer are translation, encryption/decryption, and compression.

## Session
==This is the layer responsible for opening and closing communication between the two devices.== The time between when the communication is opened and closed is known as the session. The session layer ensures that the session stays open long enough to transfer all the data being exchanged, and then promptly closes the session in order to avoid wasting resources. The session layer also synchronizes data transfer with checkpoints.

## Transport 
The transport layer (also known as layer 4) ==is responsible for end-to-end communication between the two devices.== This includes taking data from the session layer and breaking it up into chunks called segments before sending it to the Network layer (layer 3). It is also responsible for reassembling the segments on the receiving device into data the session layer can consume.

## Network 
The network layer is responsible for ==facilitating data transfer between two different networks.== The network layer ==breaks up segments from the transport layer into smaller units, called packets, on the sender's device, and reassembles these packets on the receiving device.== The network layer also finds the best physical path for the data to reach its destination this is known as routing. If the two devices communicating are on the same network, then the network layer is unnecessary.

## Data Link
The data link layer is ==very similar to the network layer, except the data link layer facilitates data transfer between two devices on the same network.== The data link layer takes packets from the network layer and breaks them into smaller pieces called frames.

## Physical
This layer includes the ==physical equipment involved in the data transfer, such as the cables and switches==. This is also the layer where the data gets converted into a bit stream, which is a string of 1s and 0s. The physical layer of both devices must also agree on a signal convention so that the 1s can be distinguished from the 0s on both devices.
