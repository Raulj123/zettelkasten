* A string is actually an array of `unicode characters`. You can perform almost all the operations we used in an array.
* Can we use ``===`` to compare two strings?
	*  Does the language support operator overloading?
		* 1. If the answer is `yes` (like C++, python), we `may` use == to compare two strings.
		1. If the answer is `no` (like Java), we `may not` use == to compare two strings. When we use == it actually compares whether these two objects are the same object.
## Immutable or Mutable 
* Immutable == no cant change
* Mutable == yes can change 
* C++ is mutable
* Python, Java immutable 

# Goodies

* Find string. Find("r") gets the index of the first 'r'
* Subset use brackets in python
