* Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability
* ACID props are used for maintaining data integrity during transaction processing 
* ## Atomic 
	* All operations in transaction succeed or every operation is rolled back
* ## Consistent
	* Completion of transaction, database is structurally sound
* ##  Isolated 
	* Transactions donâ€™t compete directly. The database manages conflicts, making them appear to run one at a time.
* ## Durable
	* Once the transaction has been completed and the writes and updates have been written to the disk, it will remain in the system even if a system failure occurs.
